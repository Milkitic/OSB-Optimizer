# Osb-Optimizer
A tool for compressing your osu!storyboard script.

## General
The modern storyboads nowadays are very complex and take up a lot of space, which can sometimes reach the maximum file size limit for .osz mapset.

This tool can compress the present .osb files that generated by osu!composer or other programming languages automatically. It is also an optimizer that can make the .osb markups formatted and a checker to check whether the .osb file has invalid expressions.

## Development
This project is only a tool with user interface.
